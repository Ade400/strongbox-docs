# Browsing 

In Strongbox there are two ways you can "browse" the artifacts:

1. Using the user interface

     <img src="/assets/screenshots/02-browse.png" data-zoomable="true"/>

2. Accessing `/api/browse`, which depending on the content negotiation, will return either `JSON` with the directories/files 
   for the requested path or a very lightweight `HTML` page.
   
     <img src="/assets/screenshots/02-browse-lightweight.png" data-zoomable="true"/>
