The REST API's documentation is available [here](http://strongbox.carlspring.org/docs/rest/api.html) and is being produced by the [strongbox-webapp](https://github.com/strongbox/strongbox-webapp) module.

There is also a Java client available via the [RestClient](https://github.com/strongbox/strongbox/blob/master/strongbox-rest-client/src/main/java/org/carlspring/strongbox/client/RestClient.java) class.
